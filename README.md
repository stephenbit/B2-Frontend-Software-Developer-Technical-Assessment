# User Directory App

Welcome to the User Directory App! This is a simple and intuitive web application that displays a list of users along with their basic details, such as name, email, phone number, and website.

## Features
The app provides the following features:
- A list of users with their names and basic details
- The ability to sort the list alphabetically by name
- Full user details, including address and company information, can be viewed by clicking on a user.

## Architecture
This app is built using React and uses the `react-router-dom` library for routing. The data is obtained from the `jsonplaceholder` API. The `UsersList` component displays the user list, and the `SingleUser` component displays the full details of a selected user.

## Future Improvements
While this app is functional and user-friendly, there is always room for improvement. Some possible future improvements include:
- Adding a search functionality to allow users to find specific users quickly
- Adding pagination to handle larger data sets more efficiently
- Improving the styling and layout to make the app more visually appealing.

## Presentation
This app was built as part of a Technical Assessment for the B2 Frontend Software Developer position. During the interview, I will present the app and discuss my thought process and decision-making. I will explain the architecture and design of the app, including the choice to use React and `react-router-dom`, the use of the `jsonplaceholder` API for data, and the features included in the app. I will also be able to discuss any challenges I faced during development and how I overcame them.

The interviewers will have the opportunity to ask questions about the app and my development process. I look forward to discussing my work on this project and demonstrating my skills as a frontend software developer.

## Installation and Usage
To run the app, you can clone the repository using the following command:

``git clone https://github.com/stephenbit/B2-Frontend-Software-Developer-Technical-Assessment.git``

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:
``npm install``


Finally, start the app using the following command:
``npm start watch``

This will start the app on ``localhost:8080``.
